.SH "NAME"
gpsprof \- profile a GPS and gpsd, plotting latency information
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
gpsprof
performs accuracy, latency, and time drift profiling on a GPS\&. It emits to standard output a GNUPLOT program that draws one of several illustrative graphs\&. It can also be told to emit the raw profile data\&.
.PP
Information from the default spatial plot it provides can be useful for establishing an upper bound on latency, and thus on position accuracy of a GPS in motion\&.
.PP
gpsprof
uses instrumentation built into
gpsd\&.
.PP
To display the graph, use
\fBgnuplot\fR(1)\&. Thus, for example, to display the default spatial scatter plot, do this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
gpsprof | gnuplot \-persist
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To generate an image file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
gpsprof \-T png | gnuplot >image\&.png
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The \-f option sets the plot type\&. The X axis is samples (either sentences with timestamps or PPS time drift messages)\&. The Y axis is normally latency in seconds, except for the spatial plot\&. Currently the following plot types are defined:
.PP
space
.RS 4
Generate a scattergram of fixes and plot a probable\-error circle\&. This data is only meaningful if the GPS is held stationary while
gpsprof
is running\&. This is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
time
.RS 4
Plot delta of system clock (NTP corrected time) against GPS time as reported in PPS messages\&.
.RE
.PP
uninstrumented
.RS 4
Plot total latency without instrumentation\&. Useful mainly as a check that the instrumentation is not producing significant distortion\&. It only plots times for reports that contain fixes; staircase\-like artifacts in the plot are created when elapsed time from reports without fixes is lumped in\&.
.RE
.PP
instrumented
.RS 4
Plot instrumented profile\&. Plots various components of the total latency between the GPS\*(Aqs fix time fix and when the client receives the fix\&.
.RE
.PP
For purposes of the description, below, start\-of\-reporting\-cycle (SORC) is when a device\*(Aqs reporting cycle begins\&. This time is detected by watching to see when data availability follows a long enough amount of quiet time that we can be sure we\*(Aqve seen the gap at the end of the sensor\*(Aqs previous report\-transmission cycle\&. Detecting this gap requires a device running at 9600bps or faster\&.
.PP
Similarly, EORC is end\-of\-reporting\-cycle; when the daemon has seen the last sentence it needs in the reporting cycle and ready to ship a fix to the client\&.
.PP
The components of the instrumented plot are as follows:
.PP
Fix latency
.RS 4
Delta between GPS time and SORC\&.
.RE
.PP
RS232 time
.RS 4
RS232 transmission time for data shipped during the cycle (computed from character volume and baud rate)\&.
.RE
.PP
Analysis time
.RS 4
EORC, minus SORC, minus RS232 time\&. The amount of real time the daemon spent on computation rather than I/O\&.
.RE
.PP
Reception time
.RS 4
Shipping time from the daemon to when it was received by
gpsprof\&.
.RE
.PP
Because of RS232 buffering effects, the profiler sometimes generates reports of ridiculously high latencies right at the beginning of a session\&. The \-m option lets you set a latency threshold, in multiples of the cycle time, above which reports are discarded\&.
.PP
The \-n option sets the number of packets to sample\&. The default is 100\&.
.PP
The \-t option sets a text string to be included in the plot title\&.
.PP
The \-T option generates a terminal type setting into the gnuplot code\&. Typical usage is "\-T png" telling gnuplot to write a PNG file\&. Without this option gnuplot will call its X11 display code\&.
.PP
The \-d option dumps the plot data, without attached gnuplot code, to a specified file for post\-analysis\&.
.PP
The \-l option dumps the raw JSON reports collected from the device to a specified file\&.
.PP
The \-r option replots from a JSON logfile (such as \-l produces) on standard input\&. Both \-n and \-l options are ignored when this one is selected\&.
.PP
The \-h option makes
gpsprof
print a usage message and exit\&.
.PP
The \-D sets debug level\&.
.PP
Sending SIGUSR1 to a running instance causes it to write a completion message to standard error and resume processing\&. The first number in the startup message is the process ID to signal\&.
